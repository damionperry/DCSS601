## The following is data summarizing the US Railroad employment numbers from 2012. 


### 'state' 
type -> character string\n
Represents the state that railroad employees worked.

### 'county' 
type -> character string\n
Represents the county within the corresponding state.

### 'num_employees' 
type -> dbl\n
Number of employees working for the railroad in the corresponding state and county. 

## Tidy & Wrangle
The original dataset has been modified to display the results for US railroad employment in Massachusetts. 

```{r}
library(readxl)
StateCounty2012 <- read_excel("HW2/StateCounty2012.xlsx", skip = 2)
state_county <- StateCounty2012[c(1,3,5)]
state_county %>% 
  rename(state = STATE, county = COUNTY, num_employees = TOTAL) %>%
  drop_na(county) %>% 
  filter(state == "MA") %>% 
  arrange(desc(num_employees))
```
